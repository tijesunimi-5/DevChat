### still a work in progress

## things to sort, for the registration page, you have to make sure you check if the user is: 
# i: Created an account
# ii: Check if the user has set up profile
# iii: checked if the user has done some other profile completion
# iv: for the logout, don't clear the user's information so user won't have to create account every single time and do the pofile setup stress, for now just confirm that the registration is working fine and get rid of the reset function, logout should only turn off the signed in state! but keep data incase of log in.

## For the analytics
# Analytics section is a section we'd work on later in future, when i have a deep knowlegde in ml and ai, purpose is to provide a feedback for developers 
## so developers can know how much the chatbot is interacted with, frequently asked question, also we want to provide a lead generation, where users can know what kind of client interacted with their chatbot, the conversation, and even know the categories of client.
